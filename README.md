# EtchASketch
A simple program mimicing the basics of a Etch A Sketch. Mousing over a square will color the square blue by default. Clicking "New Board" allows the user to define how many squares per side
of the board there will be. Click "Random Colors" will randomly select a color from a pre-defined
list when mousing over a square.
